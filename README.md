# Metric time bot
## Telegram bot @MetricTimeBot

#### Overview of metric time

Metric time is way to represent time as one number between 0 and 1.

This is very useful thing - you don't need hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds anymore.

Today, just time inside second can be represented as number beetween 0 and 1 
'''
0.243s is 243 milliseconds
'''

But, I hope, in future time inside one day will be represented as a decimal fraction beetween 0 and 1 
'''
0.542465 is 542 milliday and 465 microday
'''

Conversion of humanity to metric time will lead humanity to progress and high-efficiency
